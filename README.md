## Changelog

...

## ToDo

* provide a parameter for dual monitor setup (TexPortable.exe -dual)
* check issues with 32bit windows platforms
* provide a section/page for faq
* ~~split editor and viewer side by side~~
  * check if it works as intended on Windows 10
    * works, but a little bit quiry, needs to escape
  * what is more suitable? splitting windows with Win+Left/Right shortcuts or calculating width/height?
* ~~Run commands should be based on PID not on ahk_class or (even worse) the title~~
