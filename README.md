# TexPortable

## Wishlist

* set up a gui for configuration (templates, backup, display-setup, etc.)
* check for "new" settings file, if paths or links are "wrong" provide msgbox for adjusting them
* overwrite and backup settings from Texmaker and SumatraPDF, when custom settings files are located in a backup folder
* ~~if template file exists, load as parameter, otherwise load last/recent document from texmaker~~
* ~~check issues with 32bit windows platforms~~
* ~~provide a section/page for faq~~
* ~~include custom fonts for editor~~
* ~~run commands should be based on PID not on ahk_class or (even worse) the title~~
* ~~split editor and viewer side by side~~
  * ~~check if it works as intended on Windows 10~~
    * works, but a little bit quiry, needs to escape or sleep right after first send command
  * what is more suitable? splitting windows with Win+Left/Right shortcuts or calculating width/height?
  * provide a parameter for dual monitor setup (TexPortable.exe -dual)
